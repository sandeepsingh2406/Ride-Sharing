# Ride-Sharing
This repository contains implementation of our ride sharing algorithm, which is based on the city of the New York database.

<p>The goal is to provide a ride matching algorithm which is more efficient and provides the most dynamic way to match ride requests and ride offers in real time without pre-defining a meeting point in addition to their departure and destination locations.</p>

<p>We aim to minimize the total ridesharing travelling time of passengers, the total travel distance and travel time for vehicles.</p>

<p>We have following assumptions for our model:
<ul>
<li>No passenger will walk.</li>
<li>We will consider the distances along the road network using Graph hopper API.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll consider the maximum capacity of a vehicle as 4.</li>
<li>We are not considering the traffic conditions.</li>
<li>The maximum waiting time of each trip is 5 minutes.</li>
<li>The delay for every passenger is assumed to be 20% of total travel time if ride is individual.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The problem is solved via four steps: 
<li>Computing a pairwise request-vehicle shareability graph (RV-graph).</li>
<li>Computing a graph of feasible trips and the vehicles that can serve    them (RTV-graph).</li>
<li>Assignment of vehicles to trips.</li>
<li>We are not considering the traffic conditions.</li>
<li>Rebalancing the remaining idle vehicles.</li>
</p>
